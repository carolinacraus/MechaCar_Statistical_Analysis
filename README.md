## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression Summary](Screenshots/MechaCar_mpg%20Linear%20Regression%20Summary.png)

**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

The variables/coeffecients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values of MechaCar_mpg data were:

- vehicle_weight
- spoiler_angle
- AWD
  
**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

The slope of the linear model is not zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11,which is less than 0.05.

**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**
